This is a simple calculator with basic functions coded in HTML/CSS/JS with help from CDN / W3School / Youtube

In this project I'm practiced some concepts like:

==> HTML [Nothing special ¯\_(ツ)_/¯]

==> CSS [grid, alignment (center X_X), hover]

==> JS [constructor, functions, DOM manipulation]

This project is hosted on my Linux VM from OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) in this adress: http://152.67.55.237/ where you can run directly from your browser, Thanks to my friend Thiago for help with this <3

Do you have any questions or suggestions about this project?
